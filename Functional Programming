1) Idempotence 
___________________________________________________________________________________________
Function that always return what we expected to do pure function
Call it 1000 times and give same result its important because system become predictable 

// Uses external console.log ( communitate with outside world )
function notGood(num) { 
  console.log(num);
}

function notGood(num) { 
  return Math.random(num);
}

// Delete user from Database is Idempotence
// Http GET requestion ( always return same result )
// Call it self
Math.abs(Math.abs(-50))

2) Pure function
- 1 Task
- Return Statment
- Pure
- No shared state
- Immutable State
- Composable
- Predictable

3) Imprerative vs Declarative

4) Immutability
-Structural changes
-Any data i receve its not mine, i will always copy it ( array is object and its passed as reference )

5) Hight order functions and Closures
 Hight order Is function that take one or more functions as parameter
 Hight order Is function that return another function
 Closures access variable of scope of parent ( function inside of another function that return values )
 const closure = function() {
    let count = 0;
    return function inc() {
      count++;
      return count;
    }
 }

6) Curring

7) Partial Application

8) Memoization

9) Compose and Pipe

10) Arity
