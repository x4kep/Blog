1) Deep copying vs. shallow copying
  A deep copy means that all of the values of the new variable are copied and disconnected from the original variable.
  A shallow copy means that certain (sub-)values are still connected to the original variable.
  WHY
  We usually want to copy value when working with data so we don't have side effects ( use for Pure function )
  HOW
  Deep copy 
   -Use JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object))
   -Use some framework ( lodash - cloneDeep ) ( AngularJS - angular.copy )
  Shallow copy
   -Spred operator {...obj}
   -arr1.slice(0)
   -arr1.concat(arr2)
   -Object.create({}, obj}
   -Object.assign({}, obj}
   -Array.from(ar1)  
   
2) JavaScript is Synchronous
Spoiler: at its base, JavaScript is a synchronous, blocking, single-threaded language. That just means that only one operation can be in progress at a time.
